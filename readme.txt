This code will perform image processing to quantify Erk activity and
tissue flows from images of regenerating zebrafish scales.

The code requires MATLAB (MathWorks).
The code runs in MATLAB_R2016b. The code runs on a 
iMac (27-inch, Late 2013) macOS Sierra
Processor 3.5 GHz Intel Core i7
Memory 32 GB 1600 MHz DDR3

INSTALLATION AND USAGE
The user can run the code by changing 
MATLAB's present working directory to 'DeSimoneErkwaves2020-master'.
MS Windows users have to adapt paths to MS Windows sintax.
 
Data files are too large to include within this Github repo and must be
downloaded separately from:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/117tJhklJNEQJ3ND4D76V_xl22kcwfzZ4/view?usp=sharing
The downloaded folder must be unzipped and tne 'data' folder must be
placed in 'DeSimoneErkwaves2020-master'.

MATLAB Toolboxes required are:
- Image Processing Toolbox (version 9.5)
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (version 11.0)
- Financial Toolbox (version 5.8)
- Curve Fitting Toolbox (3.5.4)

The code requires external MATLAB functions:
loadtiff.m, saveastiff.m, weightedcov.m, xml2struct.m, nanconv.m,
brewermap.m
Those functions be downloaded from MathWorks. We attach them to the code together with
their licenses.

The main image processing routine is the script
CREATE_H2A_ERKKTR_EXAMPLE.M
The script can run altogether or each section sequentially.
In some instances, user input would be required, but
saved parameters are used for demo purposes. Users wishing to 
use custom parameters can change USESAVEDPARAMS to false
in the appropriate sections.

Sample outputs for each steps are provided in the data folder.

Scale data are saved in objects files in the "objects" folder (myScale
data struct). Stacks are saved as tiff files.

Variables that an user could change are briefly
described. 

DATA SAMPLE

A sample dataset is provided is provided (see Installation). Erk activity and tissue flow maps can
be generated using the code. 

Time-points include two channels:
ch1 -> Erk sensor (osx:ERKKtr-mCerulean)
ch2 -> osteoblast nuclear marker (osx:H2A-mCherry)

Expected output for each step is provided. 
16 Gb RAM is required
Data sample runtime: ~3h
